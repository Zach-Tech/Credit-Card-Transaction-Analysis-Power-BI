## 📈 Data Description
- **credit_card.csv / cc_add.csv** → Transaction-level data including Date, Card Type, Amount, Interest, and City.  
- **customer.csv / cust_add.csv** → Customer demographics such as Age, Gender, Occupation, Income, and Card Category.  
- Each new week’s data in `*_add.csv` ensures the dashboard reflects **real-time updates**.

## 🧩 Project Workflow

1. **Data Cleaning & Preparation (Power Query)**
   - Cleaned and transformed raw CSV files (`credit_card.csv`, `customer.csv`) using Power Query.
   - Handled missing values, corrected data types, and standardized columns.

2. **Database Creation (SQL Integration)**
   - Designed SQL schema using `SQL_create_table_Query.txt`.
   - Imported cleaned data into SQL tables for structured storage and scalability.

3. **Real-Time Data Update**
   - Added new weekly data (`cc_add.csv`, `cust_add.csv`) into SQL tables.
   - Connected Power BI to the SQL database for **real-time dashboard updates**.

4. **Data Modeling & DAX**
   - Built data relationships and created DAX measures for KPIs:
     - Total Revenue  
     - Total Interest  
     - Transaction Count  
     - Transaction Amount  
     - Customer Satisfaction Score (CSS)

5. **Dashboard Development (Power BI)**
   - Designed two dashboards for clear, actionable insights:
     - 📊 **Credit Card Transaction Report**
     - 👥 **Credit Card Customer Report**
